The I404 must be in non-terminal mode for this protocol file to work. This is
the only way it will successfully read out the values for each of the input
currents.

To put it into non-terminal mode, issue the following commands from Asyn, telnet
or netcat:

SYST:PASS 12345
SYST:COMM:TERM 0

The response to SYST:COMM:TERM? should be 
SYST:COMM:TERM?
0

This whole response won't be visible from an Asyn record, but will be from
telnet or netcat.
